# Compositional Distributional Semantics

Compositional semantics gives a way of composing words, but has no concept 
of word meaning. Distributional semantics help define the word meanings, but 
had no means of composing words. Exploiting the fact that Lambek's Pregroup 
Grammars and vector spaces share a common structure, Coecke et al. 2010 
describes method of composing the meaning we get from our distributional 
model using the syntactic structure of a sentence, thus creating a compositional
distributional model of semantics. This repository details my readings on this
subject, and ideas that arise from it.

The papers I'm reading are [here](./read/CONTENTS.md).
